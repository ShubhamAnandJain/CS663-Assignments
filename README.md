# CS663-Assignments
As part of our Digital Image Processing course at IIT Bombay, we implemented many image processing algorithms across 5 assignments. The rough distributions are:\
\
Assignment 1 - Transformations, Histogram Matching & Equalization\
Assignment 2 - Filtering (Bilateral, Patch-based filter)\
Assignment 3 - Segmentation\
Assignment 4 - Singular Value Decomposition, PCA, Face Recognition System\
Assignment 5 - 2D Fourier Transforms, Image Restoration\
\
Here, you can find all the codes in the corresponding "code" folder and all the reports in the "report" folder. Problem statements are given in the corresponding assignments as well.
